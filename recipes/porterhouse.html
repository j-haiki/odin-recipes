        <p>This flagship, Tuscan steak is made from the region's Chianina breed of cattle which are prized for their tenderness and flavor. In typical Italian style, simplicity rules the day; little more than olive oil, rosemary, and salt are needed to highlight the rich flavor of the grilled meat. With Italian food, freshness and quality are top priority, so I use nothing less than choice porterhouse, and much prefer prime!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (2 1/2 pound) choice or prime porterhouse steak</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Tuscan olive oil</li>
        <li>Moist, grey sea salt and freshly cracked pepper to taste</li>
        <li>6 lemon wedges</li>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Press chopped rosemary onto both sides of porterhouse steak; set onto a plate and allow to marinate at room temperature for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Start an outdoor grill using hardwood charcoal, such as hickory. When coals are white and glowing, arrange for high heat.</li>
            <li>Gently brush or rub olive oil onto steak, then season to taste with sea salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place steak onto grill, and cook until a dark, golden brown (not burnt) crust forms, 5 to 10 minutes depending on thickness of meat. Turn over, and continue cooking until golden on the other side, 5 to 10 minutes more. When finished, place steak onto a platter, and allow to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>To serve, remove the two pieces of meat from the bone, and replace the bone onto the serving platter. Trim any unwanted fat from the round (tenderloin) steak, slice into 6 equal pieces at an angle to the grain, and fan out on one side of the bone. Slice the rectangular (loin) steak into 1/4-inch slices at an angle to the grain. Fan out on the other side of the bone. Finish by garnishing the platter with lemon wedges and a sprinkle of additional sea salt.</li>   
        </ol>
